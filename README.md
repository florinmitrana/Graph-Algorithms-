# Graph-Algorithms-

## Overview ## 

Graph algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and are used to analyze and manipulate networks of interconnected nodes, known as graphs.

These algorithms serve various purposes, including finding the shortest path between two nodes, determining whether a graph is connected, detecting cycles, and identifying important nodes or clusters within a network.

## Implemented Algorithms ## 

• DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

Algorithms for processing directed graphs that lack cycles.

• DFS (Depth-First Search)

Traversal method that explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.

• BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Traversal technique that explores all vertices at the same level before moving to the next level.

• Dijkstra's Algorithm

Determines the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with weighted edges.

•Levenshtein Distance

Computes the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform one string into another.

•Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

Identifies the maximum flow in a network with flows.

• Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Calculates the shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a weighted graph.

• Kahn's Algorithm 

Discovers a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph.

• Kosaraju's Algorithm

Identifies strongly connected components within a directed graph.

•Kruskal's Algorithm

Determines a minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.

•Prim's Algorithm

Finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.

•Tarjan's Algorithm

Identifies strongly connected components within a directed graph.
